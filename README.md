# mini-self-driving-car
A basic self-driving car using Verilog developed for the CSC258 project at the University of Toronto. Due to time constraints (3 weeks):
- This project is meant to accomplish the most basic functionality of a self-driving car that can be implemented on an FPGA, i.e. that of a road follower.
- It is not meant to implement Machine Learning functionalities such as object detection or semantic segmentation.
For a real self-driving car, I'm on the Perception subteam of [aUToronto](https://www.autodrive.utoronto.ca/), the University of Toronto's autonomous vehicle team. We are the 2018 and 2019 Champions of North America at the [SAE/GM AutoDrive Challenge](https://www.sae.org/attend/student-events/autodrive-challenge/).
